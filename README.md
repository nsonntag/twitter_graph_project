# Twitter Graph Project
This repo contains the code used for a class graph project in an online course.  The code for this project is designed to create graph data structures using the Twitter REST API and Twitter4j.  These graphs can be written to disk a reloaded at a future time. 

Typical graph methods such as addEdge(), addVertex() etc. are available, as well as methods to locate the existence of "mother nodes", depth first search, and finding a dominating set.  

Sample graphs and Twitter user lists can be found in the resources folder.

Use at your own risk, rigorous testing has not been completed on all portions of the code.
